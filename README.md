# Viscek Model Simulation

## Introduction
The Viscek model is a system of N self-propelled particles moving in 2D space. The particles align their velocities with those of their neighbors within a certain radius of influence. The model exhibits collective behavior such as swarming and phase transitions as the density of particles and the radius of influence are varied. This implementation allows the user to simulate the Viscek model [1] and output a `.gif` animation of the particles' motion over time.

Note that the (original) simulation program [2] written in C language for simulating the behavior of a system of active particles in a 2D confined box is available as `CircularConfinement.c`. The program includes force calculations, particle movement, and collision detection algorithms. 

## Installation
To run the simulation, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- imageio
- tqdm

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib imageio tqdm`

## Output
The output of the simulation is a .gif animation of the particles' motion over time. The animation will be saved as `animation.gif` in the working directory.

## Usage
To run the simulation, follow these steps:
1. Adjust the simulation parameters in the `parameters.py` file.
2. Run the `MainProgram.py` script.
3. The output animation will be saved as `animation.gif` in the working directory.

You can adjust the following parameters in the `parameters.py` file:
- `N`: number of particles
- `L`: size of simulation domain
- `Pspeed`: self-propulsion speed of particles
- `eta`: noise parameter
- `rad_influence`: radius of interaction
- `Tstart`: start time of simulation
- `Tend`: end time of simulation
- `deltat`: time step
- `bcond`: boundary condition ('periodic' or 'reflective')

## Example
Run the simulation using this command:
`python MainProgram.py`

Example animation generated by this implementation for high noise (chaotic motion) and low noise (organized motion):
